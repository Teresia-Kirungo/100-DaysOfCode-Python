# Music Band Name Generator
# Instructions : ðŸ‘‡
# Write a program that welcomes the user to the  Music Band Name Generator. 
# The Name Generator prompts a user for the name of the City they grew up in and the name of their pet. 
# The Name Generator then combines these two names to give the user their Band Name.

# Source Code

#1. Creates a greeting that welcomes the user to the Band Name Generator.
print("Welcome to the Music Band Name Generator.")

city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")

#3. Ask the user for the name of their pet.
pet_name = input("What's the name of your pet?\n")

#4. Combines the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your band name is " + pet_name + " " + city)

# This can also be written like this because of using f-string
