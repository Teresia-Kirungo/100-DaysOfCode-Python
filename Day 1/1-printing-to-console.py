# Printing to the Console
# Instructions
# Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function. 
# **Warning:** The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.
# Example Output
# After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following: 
    # Day 1 - Python Print Function

# The function is declared like this:
    # print('what to print')


#Write your code below this line 
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")
