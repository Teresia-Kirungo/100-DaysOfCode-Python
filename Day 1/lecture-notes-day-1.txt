Syntax error is mostly associated with errors in the string.
Indentation is very very important in Python! pay attention
Text editors have code Intelligence which helps you complete your code or gives you hints on code that is not done correctly.
The console will always give you hints of the mistakes you make

THNGS TO NOTE
f-strings are a great way to format strings. Not only are they more readable, more concise, and less prone to error than other ways of formatting, but they are also faster!

ðŸ‘‡This is an example of how f-strings are usedðŸ‘‡
print(f"Hi {name}, your name is {characterNumber} characters long.")

It always takes longer to get the grip of something when you are starting; keep at it!
