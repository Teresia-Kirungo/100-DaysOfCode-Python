Syntax error is mostly associated with errors in the syntax of the code in this case the string.

String Concatenation is used to join two items of the same data type. Concatenation is the joining of two data items.
String Concatenation is done with the + sign.

\"+\" use of the forward slash is to tell the computer the "" in between are also to be printed.

Indentation is very very important in Python! Pay attention
Text editors have code Intelligence which helps you complete your code or gives you hints on code that is not done correctly.
The console will always give you hints of the mistakes you make

Variables are used to store data values in a programming language e.g name = James

⭐ Best Practice; 
-> Have sensible variable names, and clean code.
-> Don't use keywords as variable names.

THNGS TO NOTE
f-strings are a great way to format strings. Not only are they more readable, more concise, and less prone to error than other ways of formatting, but they are also faster!

👇This is an example of how f-strings are used👇
print(f"Hi {name}, your name is {characterNumber} characters long.")

It always takes longer to get the grip of something when you are starting; keep at it!
