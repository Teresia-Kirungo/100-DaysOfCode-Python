# Odd or Even
# Instructions: https://replit.com/@terrykirungo/1-odd-or-even
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder. 
# e.g. 86 is **even** because 86 Ã· 2 = 43, 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

# Odd Numbers
# e.g. 59 is **odd** because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5
# 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

# The **modulo** is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division. 
# e.g. 6 Ã· 2 = 3 with no remainder. 
# 6 % 2 = 0

# 5 Ã· 2 = 2.5 remainder is 1.
# 5 % 2 = 1

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# We know that dividing using % modulo gives you a reminder, so any number % 2 that gives a reminder(a number) is an odd number
if number % 2 == 0:
  print("This is an even number")
else:
  print("This is an odd number")
