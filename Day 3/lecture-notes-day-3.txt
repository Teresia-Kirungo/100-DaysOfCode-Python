What we will learn; condiional statements, logcal operations and local and global naming
At the end of ot all you will build a Treasure Island.

An if/else statement is a type of a conditional statemrnt; depending on a particular condition we weould do either a or b.This is what the code-block would look like:
Source Code looks like this: ðŸ‘‡

if condition:
  do this
else
  do this

Comparison Operators 
  > greater than operator
  < less than operator
  >= greater than or equal to operator
  <= less than or equal to operator
  == equality operator checks for eqaul to
  =! NOT equality operator checks for eqaul to

= assignment operator, asigns a value to a variable

> greater than operator
< less than operator
>= greater than or equal to operator
<= less than or equal to operator
% modulus operator it divides a number and gives you a remainder of the division
  Example: 7 % 2 this gives you 1 -> it gives you the remainder once a number is divided by another.
           6 % 2 gives you zero because there's no reminder
           
Supposing we have more than one condition, an extra condition, to check we use a Nested if/else
Source Code looks like this: ðŸ‘‡

if condition:
  if another condition:
    do this
   else:
    do this
else:
  do this
