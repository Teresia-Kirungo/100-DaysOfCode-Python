# List
fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Mango"]

#for, followed by a keyword(name), we choose to give to a single item - in our code below the word is tunda - in the list followed the actual name of the list we want to iterate through
# Everytime the for loop runs the variable tunda is assigned to an item in the fruits list i.e

for tunda in fruits:
    # Everytime the for loop runs the variable tunda is assigned to an item in the fruits list 
    print(tunda)
    # Prints items(the fruits) in the list while adding Pie to the name
    print("Here's an " + tunda + " pie") 
    
    # indentation is really important in for loops; everything that's indented after the for loop is inside the for loop
    # i.e Apple
    # Here's an Apple pie
    # It excutes until the last item in the List
