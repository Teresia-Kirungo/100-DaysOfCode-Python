# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
# split() puts the items separated by a comma(,) in a List like this 123, 145, 236, 267, 190
# 123 145 236 267 190

for height in student_heights:
    #The first time this ğŸ‘‡ line runs the total height will equate to 0  -which is what we have initialised the total height to- . The next time it loops the total height will be added to the first item in the list provided. It will run this line of code(LOOP) until the last item on the list.
    # total_height = total_height + height
