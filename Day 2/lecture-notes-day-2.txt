Learning; working with numbers, and conversion types
TypeError happens when we mix data types
Data Types include: 
  -> Strings - "hellow"
  -> Intergers - whole numbers 123,456
  -> Float - Numbers with decimal places 12.54
  -> Booleans - True and False 
  
Subscripting pulling out a letter from a string using square brackets []:
  e.g like if we have "hello" and we want to pull out "h"
  -> we'll write print("Hello"[0]) this will pop out the letter "H"
  
Functions
type() helps us know the type of data type we are working with
  print(type(Variable)) #print the data type of the variable
type conversion or type casting; changing one type of data to another 
  e.g theVariableWeAreConverting = str(variableWeWantToConvert) #converst the variable data type to a string
  
Maths Operations
  Add +
  Minus -
  Multiply *
  Divide /
  Power  **
  When it comes to Maths we use PEMDAS -> Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.
  round(number/number) rounds off a number to the nearest whole number
  round(number/number, 2) rounds up a number two decimal places or any number you set this value to
  number //number  floor division rounds off automatically to two decimal places
  number = number + 1, can be written as number += 1
