# find out the data type of the input received
print(two_digit_number, " is of type ",type(two_digit_number)) # the input received from the user is a string

# Converting the string data type to intergers
first_digit = int(two_digit_number[0])

# Checks if conversion was successful
# print(type(first_digit)) # successful conversion of string data type to interger
# print(type(last_digit))

# Prints the sum of the two-digit-number
sum = first_digit + last_digit
print("The sum of the two-digit-number is:", sum)
