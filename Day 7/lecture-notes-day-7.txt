Building a Hangman project
You have to guess a letter and for every wrong letter, your "hangman" loses a life; in this case a part of the body.
If you guess the right word, the number of lives remain intact.

Here's the hangman Program flow simple version:
1) Generate a random word.
2) Go to step (3)

Here's the hangman Program flow hard version:
1) Generate random words and add them in a list.
2) From the list, pick a random word

3) Generate as many black as letters in the word in (2)
4) Provide the first letter of the word
5) Ask the user to guess a letter in that word
6) If the guessed letter is in the word, replace the blank space with that letter; display life preserved!
7) If the guessed letter is not in the word the blank remains blank; and the hangman loses a life.
