We are learning about Code blocks, indentation, functions and while loops.
We did this using the Karel -Reeborg Robot.
Functions we've already used; len() function
When we want to start our own functions we start with a keyword def e'g

def the_name_of_the_function():
  #Do this
  #Then do this
  #Finally do this

A function can have inputs e'.g
def the_name_of_the_function(input):
  #Do this
  
 # Calling the function
 the_name_of_the_function()
