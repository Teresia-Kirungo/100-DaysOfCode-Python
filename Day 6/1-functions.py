# This is an example of a print function
print("Hello world!")

# When we want to start our own functions we start with a keyword def as shown below
#def stands for defining
# after defining our function we give it a name e.g
def name_of_the_function():
    print("This is how you create a funtion: using the keyword def and the name of the function")
def my_function():
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")

# This is how you call the function
my_function()

#You call the function outside the scope of that function in simple terms outside it's indentation
name_of_the_function()
